## 🚀 Full Setup Guide (DO THIS STEP BY STEP)

---

### 1.Install Python

Check if Python is already installed:

```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

If not, download and install Python from:  
-> https://www.python.org/downloads/

---

### 2. Install pip (Python package installer)

Usually comes with Python. If not:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

---

### 3. Install Selenium

Run this command:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

Also add this line to `requirements.txt`:

```
selenium
```

---

### 4. Install Google Chrome

If you don’t have it:  
->https://www.google.com/chrome/

---

### 5.Install ChromeDriver (VERY IMPORTANT)

Selenium uses this to control Chrome.

#### Step 1: Check your Chrome version

Open Chrome → go to: `chrome://settings/help`  
Note the version (e.g. `114.0.5735.110`)

#### Step 2: Download the matching ChromeDriver

Go to:  
->https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/  
Download the version that matches your Chrome version.

#### Step 3: Set ChromeDriver path

- **On macOS**:

```bash
mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chromedriver
```

- **On Windows**:
  Place `chromedriver.exe` somewhere like `C:\chromedriver\`

Update this line in `windows_course_bot.py`:

```python
CHROMEDRIVER_PATH = "C:\chromedriver\chromedriver.exe"
```

## How to Get Subject Form IDs??

You need a subject’s unique **form ID** to register it with the bot.

### Steps:

1. Open course registration page on Chrome:
   ->`https://reg.exam.dtu.ac.in/student/courseRegistration/<your-session-id>`

2. Right-click on the **"Register"** button of the subject → using **Inspect** element

3. Look for a line like:

   ```html
   <form
     action="/student/courseRegistration/64971609f608d957ec3b280e/686e5514d00bc35c8c12bd83"
   ></form>
   ```

4. The full form ID = everything after `/courseRegistration/`  
   Example:

   ```
   64971609f608d957ec3b280e/686e5514d00bc35c8c12bd83
   ```

5. Add to the `FORM_IDS` dict in the script like:

   ```python
   FORM_IDS = {
       "Creative Writing Skills": "64971609f608d957ec3b280e/686e5514d00bc35c8c12bd83"
   }
   ```

Repeat for all the subjects you want to auto-register.

## "Edit Your DTU Login Credentials in the Script"

Open either `mac_course_bot.py` or `windows_course_bot.py` and update:

```python
ROLL_NO = "Your DTU Roll Number"
PASSWORD = "Your DTU Password"
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Bot

### On macOS:

```bash
python3 mac_course_bot.py
```

### On Windows:

```bash
python windows_course_bot.py
```

**Keep it running before registration opens**. It will detect when the "Register" button becomes clickable and click it instantly.

---

## Optional: Delete Temp Chrome Profile (if needed)

The script creates a temp Chrome profile each time. You can delete it:

- **macOS**:

  ```bash
  rm -rf /tmp/course-bot-*
  ```

- **Windows**:  
  Delete folder like: `C:\Windows\Temp\course-bot-*`

---

## Crash Debugging

If something goes wrong, the bot saves a screenshot as `error.png` in the project directory so you can see what happened.

---

## Important Notes:

- 🔐 **Never upload your credentials** to GitHub or anywhere public.
- 🧠 Only run this during elective registration hours.
- 🚀 This is meant to beat the rush — don’t abuse it.
- 🛑 Don’t open the same portal in another tab while this is running.
